## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Security Issues ✅

1. **Missing Timeouts on Network Operations**
   - **Issue**: HTTP, TLS, and QUIC connections had no timeouts, which could lead to hanging connections and resource exhaustion
   - **Fix**: Added 10-second timeouts to all network operations:
     - HTTP client with context-based timeout
     - TLS connections with dialer timeout and deadline
     - QUIC connections with context timeout
     - Standard DNS client timeout

2. **No Connection Pooling for HTTP Client**
   - **Issue**: Each DoH request created a new HTTP client, wasting resources
   - **Fix**: Implemented a global HTTP client with connection pooling:
     - 100 max idle connections
     - 10 max idle connections per host
     - 90-second idle connection timeout

3. **Resource Leaks in QUIC Implementation**
   - **Issue**: QUIC streams were not properly closed in all error paths
   - **Fix**: Added proper `defer stream.Close()` to ensure cleanup

4. **Weak TLS Configuration**
   - **Issue**: No minimum TLS version specified
   - **Fix**: Set `MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12` for all TLS configurations

5. **Insecure Mode Warning**
   - **Issue**: `--insecure` flag had no visible warning to users
   - **Fix**: Added prominent warning messages with emoji when insecure mode is enabled

### Code Quality Issues ✅

1. **Code Formatting**
   - **Issue**: Inconsistent spacing in const declarations
   - **Fix**: Applied `gofmt` to entire codebase

2. **Missing Error Context**
   - **Issue**: Errors were returned without context, making debugging difficult
   - **Fix**: Wrapped all errors with descriptive messages using `fmt.Errorf` with `%w`

3. **No Input Validation**
   - **Issue**: No validation for bind address or port ranges
   - **Fix**: Added validation for:
     - Port range (1-65535)
     - Bind address (valid IP format)

4. **Missing Documentation**
   - **Issue**: Functions lacked documentation comments
   - **Fix**: Added godoc-style comments for all exported and important functions

5. **Hardcoded Values**
   - **Issue**: Magic numbers like timeout values were hardcoded
   - **Fix**: Added comments explaining the values and their purpose

### Functionality Issues ✅

1. **Incorrect DNS Response Handling**
   - **Issue**: Server failed when DNS response had empty answers, but NXDOMAIN is a valid response
   - **Fix**: Changed logic to only fail if no response is received, not if response has no answers

2. **No Graceful Shutdown**
   - **Issue**: Server didn't handle SIGTERM/SIGINT signals properly
   - **Fix**: Implemented graceful shutdown with:
     - Signal handlers for SIGTERM and SIGINT
     - 5-second timeout for shutdown
     - Proper cleanup of both UDP and TCP servers

3. **Poor Error Messages**
   - **Issue**: Error messages didn't provide enough context
   - **Fix**: Improved all log messages with better context and categorization

4. **Missing Upstream Count Validation**
   - **Issue**: No check if any valid upstreams were loaded
   - **Fix**: Added validation and fatal error if no upstreams found

### Protocol Improvements ✅

1. **DoT Protocol Name**
   - **Issue**: TLS ALPN was set to "tls" instead of standard "dot"
   - **Fix**: Changed to "dot" for proper DoT protocol compliance

2. **HTTP Status Code Checking**
   - **Issue**: DoH responses didn't validate HTTP status codes
   - **Fix**: Added check for HTTP 200 OK status

## Security Analysis

### CodeQL Results
✅ **No security vulnerabilities detected**

The code was analyzed with CodeQL and passed all security checks.

### Security Best Practices Implemented

1. ✅ Input validation on all user inputs
2. ✅ Timeouts on all network operations
3. ✅ Proper resource cleanup with defer statements
4. ✅ Minimum TLS version enforcement (TLS 1.2+)
5. ✅ Clear warnings for insecure operations
6. ✅ Connection pooling to prevent resource exhaustion
7. ✅ Graceful shutdown to prevent data loss
8. ✅ Proper error handling with context

## Testing

   - Add unit tests for each DNS forwarding function
   - Add integration tests with mock DNS servers
   - Add benchmark tests for performance monitoring

2. **Configuration**
   - Support for multiple upstream configs with priorities
   - Hot-reload of configuration without restart
   - Support for YAML/JSON config format in addition to current format

3. **Features**
   - DNS query caching to reduce upstream load
   - Metrics/monitoring endpoint (Prometheus format)
   - Rate limiting per client
   - Query logging (with privacy considerations)
   - Support for DNS-over-HTTPS/3 (HTTP/3)

4. **Documentation**
   - Add example systemd service file
   - Add troubleshooting guide
   - Add performance tuning guide
   - Add architecture diagram

5. **Security**

- ✅ More secure with proper timeouts and resource management
- ✅ More robust with better error handling
- ✅ More maintainable with documentation and proper formatting
- ✅ More user-friendly with better warnings and validation
- ✅ Production-ready with graceful shutdown handling

All changes maintain backward compatibility and follow Go best practices.
